# Timeline Of Witchcraft

The purpose of this project is to create a website detailing the history of witches and witchcraft around the world.

The hope is that this project will include the following features in its code:
<ul>
<li>A responsive menu with CSS.</li>
<li>Transition animation(s) to an element on hover</li>
<li>A simple hide/show div with CSS</li>
<li>A JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page</li>
</ul>

For my personal testing I utilized Visual Studio code as my IDE with the extension "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey, but this is not a requirement to test the html and CSS.

At this time, I have the basic code regarding the functionality I want in my website. For visual appeal I am attempting to use the parallax scrolling effect and javascript to randomize the images displayed to the user. Media queries are set to adjust the navbar, which for defualt mobile displays "Hello World" in place for a logo, my show/hide dive with a common witch related phrase, and a hamburger menu with a tappable dropdown. For tablet the navbar expands and removes the hamburger menu with the fully listed menu. For desktop the navbar moves to the side and stays visible to the user with menu items that change color on hover and "Jump To" having a hoverable dropdown menu.

For now, I still lack information to provide the user with a brief explanation of witches and witchcraft as well its history through the world. 
Further, the navbar menu items are not fully functional and only serve to redirect to the current page. To be implemented is an about page of myself and the purpose of the website, and "Jump To" option for the user to quickly navigate to different parts of witch history.
